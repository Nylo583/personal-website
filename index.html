                            <p>My first completed Hackathon was for the World World Youth Coders Hackathon. I remember one of my friends (let’s call him S) proposed, as a joke, to create an AI fan for the theme of “Beating the Heat”. We called up our third group member in Canada (Mr. C for no other reason) and production was underway.<br><br>

                                We had an entire week (wrong, we wasted 2 days on the idea) to create an integrated smart fan, complete with a website interface. I would handle the AI model and the website, C would work on the web server, and S would tackle sensing and hardware.<br><br>
                                
                                It took me around a day to set up the Tensorflow model in Python and train it on systematically generated data. The end goal of the Fannergy system was to spin the fan at a pace which would attempt to cancel out changes in room temperature and humidity and keep the room at a pleasant 70 degrees Fahrenheit. If I had more time, I would’ve pulled data from an API to make a better dataset, but I went with the “random-number-and-calculate” dataset generation method. In the end, it worked out with a 0.05% margin of error after 500 or so epochs of training.<br><br>

                                It was now day 4 and time to get started on the website. Our team ended up deciding to create a home page, ID login, and a control board page which would either set a manual fan speed or give way to the AI to make decisions for the user. It would also include JS graphs of historical temperature and humidity readings. This was my first expedition into making websites, so it took me the great deal of the rest of the last 4 days to come up with a somewhat-pleasing-to-the-eye interface. See the demonstration below, or take a look at the screenshots below.<br><br> 
                                
                                In the end, this project netted us $600 and the title of World World Youth Coders Hackathon winners!<br><br>

                            <p>Wouldn't you like to have all the time in the world? Meet Bartholomeow, who spends his time sunbathing and counting down the days until his wooden rafter reaches his destination. <br><br>
                                <img src="assets/setsail/bartholomeow.png"><br><br>
                                I've always been one to count down the days of school, summer vacation, and other spans of time. Thus, for my one-week-before-school procrastination project, I decided to give Bartholomeow a proper opportunity to be seen in a progress-tracker app. <br><br>
                                I opened up Godot and got to work. My first goal was to tackle the actual progress screen. Bartholomeow would remain in the middle, floating back and forth on his raft, as hes traversed a procedurally-generated world. To accomplish this, I first made a generator and recycler which would hover off-screen, top and bottom respectively.
                                I decided to implement OpenSimplexNoise in order to generate the world. Then, it was just adjusting the ranges for the land generation, and clearing the middle for our beloved cat to traverse along the river. <br><br>
                                Zoomed-out view of the generator and recycler:<br><br>

                                After that, things were very straightforward. I implemented a percentage through the date range using unix timestamps, and added some more visual niceties to the program. Finally, to wrap up my project rush week, I added a menu and basic goal-saving for convenience. <br><br>

                                With perfect timing, I finished the day before my junior year of school started. Now, I'm sitting here, writing a devlog about it in the last week of that very same school year. Here, have a screenshot of Bartholomeow's journey at 99% completion, as well as a few more demos.<br><br>

                                This website was made for the Northville High School Computer Science Honor Society, of which I am a vice president. Over the course of winter break my junior year, I designed the static webpages that would be displayed for members to check volunteer hours, announcements, and more.
                                While this website doesn't feature anything super left-field or complicated, I am still very satisfied as this was my first real website (which actually did normal website things). Enjoy some screenshots!<br><br>

                                This project was completed for a freelancing job, but due to conditions out of control this has become my "example website" for future freelancing expeditions. It features a rotating carousel homepage, detailed pricing pages and contact/about pages.
                                This was definitely my first real step into the more complicated world of web development. Starting to utilize animations to create more advanced interactions, playing around with responsiveness and Bootstrap, this website was integral to my current knowledge of website development.<br><br>

                                Yes, you heard that right! I want to talk about this website because it is, in essence, the culmination of everything I've been learning and developing for the past few years. I wanted to move away from the standard professional look that most of my websites featured, firstly, and instead chose a more modern styling.
                                Secondly, I knew a personal website would be different in the fact that it should be only one page. That means no navbar, no redirecting, just one scrollable sheet to display myself to the world. All of this led me to look into scroll snapping, a concept I was previously unaware of, to provide a better navigating expereince for the user.
                                Lastly, I want to talk about the project page you're looking at right now. It uses a combination of radio button signals and transitions to make each page slide in and out without the use of JS at all. Thanks for checking out this page!<br><br>

                            <p>For my Create Task portion of AP Computer Science Principles, I decided to challenge myself a bit and create Sudoku using C++ (something I resoundly hate). A lot of the first few weeks was setting up my window and creating the game board, as I researched Sudoku generation algorithms and implementation.
                                After finishing the graphical task of creating a Sudoku-esque board on the terminal window, I decided to create my own rendition of a Sudoku board generator which uses backtracking to fill the board according to the game's rules. Then, I saved a copy of that board, and removed most of the tiles to form the initial game board the user would play on. Here's a graphical representation of the algorithm I implemented, as well as how it turned out in the terminal at first.<br><br>

                                <img src="assets/sudoku/board1.png"><br><br>
                                I then displayed that board to the window, and inserted simple WASD (+ other keys) controls in order to traverse and edit the game board. As shown in the demo, I additionally coded an automatic error checking system which would highlight tiles which broke Sudoku rules in red. As a finishing touch, I added the option to generate a new board at any time using the backtracking algorithm from earlier, after seeing that the program was unusable once the game completed.<br><br>

                            <p>School was starting to slow down, so I challenged myself to a one-week personal challenge. I had always wanted to predict stock prices using AI, so I did some research on LSTM (long-short term memory) AI regression models for stock prices and began work.
                                Training the model was the easy part of this project. I simply downloaded ticker data from the yfinance library, then ran it through a Tensorflow LSTM model to get some pretty accurate results. <br><br>
                                <img class="full" src="assets/stocks/accurate.png"><br><br>
                                To having it predict future data, however, was quite tricky. First, I changed the test region of the model to look into the future. Then, I needed to store the model's predictions for use in future predictions as it starts to "look back" on its old estimates to generate more forecasts.
                                The only problem was that the model would begin to crash its predictions to zero for any stock once it was only predicting from its own prior forecasting. <br><br>

                                Either I raise the look-back period to accurately see more days, and have it be exponentially slower, or keep the look-back and efficiency as it was. Tough choice, but nevertheless, the model works beautifully at generating trendlines that rely solely on historical data.<br><br>

                                If you want to compile it, you can <a href="">here</a>, just make sure you do not make real financial decisions with this model. It can't see the state of the market or ticker-specific happenings, and is therefore not a good representation of the future stock outlook. <br><br>
